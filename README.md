# AiRCraft
## 💡Inspiration
We love playing minecraft and we love building houses in minecraft. We wanted to take that experience into the AR realm (in our own physical spaces) to explore our minecraft creations!!!

## 😃 What it does
AiRCraft is a Voxel-Based AR application where you can bulid and import minecraft houses using a wide variety of blocks to choose from. AiRCraft will detect flat surfaces and allow you to start building your creations from the ground up!

## 🤷‍♀️ How we built it
We built this using Unity 3D, and using google AR core. We further built on top of the plane detection and anchor placing system with a voxel anchoring system and a block switching system and a stylistic UI!!!

## 🎮 Challenges we ran into
Although one of us has made an AR application before, we have never applied it to such variety and to work with a voxel-building system. In addition, it is Qianxi's first hackathon and first time using unity! So this was a great learning oppportunity for her and she actually contributed and learned a lot for the UI and block-switching system!!

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of the voxel-based anchoring system. Where the entire block grid is aligned with the camera in a grid system. We are also very proud of the quick learning and problem solving skills during first hackathon (Qianxi)!!

## 📚 What we learned
We learned a lot about android app development and the workflow needed for collaborating on a mobile app. We also learned a lot about the Unity engine and Google AR core development alongside many quirks and drawbacks with trying to work with AR.

## ⛅ What's next for AiRCraft
For the future, expanding onto aircraft, we hope to add a larger variety of blocks and maybe even a survival mode like in the real game minecraft. It would be cool to one day take the entire survival multiplayer minecraft experience into AR like we had originally dreamed of doing.
