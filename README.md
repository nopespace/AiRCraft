# desktop-sandcastles

## 🍧 Inspiration
With many of the beaches either closed or extremely crowded because of the COVID-19 lockdown, going to the beach these days is hard. We though of creating a way of taking a piece the beach experience home or wherever you go.

## 🏖 What it does
Desktop sandcastles in an AR application that allows you to detect the surfaces around you and start constructing virtual sand castles on your own virtual beach no matter where you are!

## 🛠️ How we built it
Languages\Editors: C#, Unity3D, Android Studio
Frameworks\Development Kits: AR Core, AR Core Foundations, JDK, Android SDK
Modelling: Blender

## 🚧 Challenges we ran into
Developing in a AR framework for the first time
Plane detection / Touch screen block-placing
AR Device Compatibility Issues

## ✅ Accomplishments that we're proud of
Building a realtime 3D AR application
Sand castle building system
Plane raycast detection system

## 💡 What we learned
Learned how to develop AR applications!
AR Core Foundations Unity package
Developing for Android for the first time

## 💭 What's next for Desktop Sandcastles
Multiplayer Sandcastles!! AR Core Foundation already has some Cloud multiplayer foundations and we would love to be able to make this application live multiplayer in the future. Bring the beach and your friends to your beaches wherever you go!
